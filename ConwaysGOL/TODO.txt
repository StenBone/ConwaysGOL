KISS
You're new at this, go slow
Slow is smooth, Smooth is fast, smooth is progress
Goal: Conway's game of life
Tools: Visual Studio, SFML
For the game framework look at other open source projects, see what's out there and choose what you like
Conventions are the same ones used in the CPP Memory Management Course

Game Start:
See blank grid
User clicks where they want to add cells
Press space bar and simulation starts with one more per second
Cells go off grid, they die

Don't go to Github until you have to or at the end. Focus on writing code.
